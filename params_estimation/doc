The provided directory contains a set of Python files, each containing a class named `ParameterEstimation`.
This class  is designed  to  estimate  unknown  parameters  (r0, r_0, r4, and d) for a set of differential
equations  using a  gradient-based  optimization  approach.  The code  is  structured  as  a practical and
computationally  efficient  alternative  to the  "parameter_estimation_using_mse.py"  approach.  Here's  a
breakdown of the key features and structure of each file:

1) Class-Based Structure:
The code is organized into a class called `ParameterEstimation`, which enhances modularity and readability
by encapsulating all the necessary functionality within the class.


2) Initialization:
The constructor (`__init__` method) accepts various input parameters and hyperparameters required for parameter
estimation. This initialization step ensures that the class is set up with all the necessary information.


3) Concentration Simulation:
The `simulate_concentration` method is responsible for modeling the change in species concentrations over time.
It initializes species concentrations,  computes derivatives,  and iteratively  updates species concentrations
based on a set of chemical reactions.


4) MSE Calculator:
The `mean_squared_error` method calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the simulated data and
experimental data. MSE is a critical metric for assessing the accuracy of the estimated parameters.


5) Gradient Descent:
The `gradient_descent` method employs  a  gradient descent optimization technique  to  iteratively  update
the coefficients (r0, r_0, r4, and d) in an attempt to minimize the MSE. This is the core of the parameter
estimation process, and the code provides a mechanism for optimizing these parameters effectively.


6) Early Stopping:
The code includes a mechanism for early stopping, which helps terminate the optimization process when the change
in MSE falls below a certain threshold. This is a practical approach to avoid unnecessary  computations when the
optimization process has converged.


7) Improved Parameter Initialization:
The coefficients (r0, r_0, r4, and d) are initialized with reasonable values before the optimization process begins.
This is crucial for starting the optimization process from a point that is likely to converge to a good solution.

8) Results and Population Tracking:
The `gradient_descent` method not only optimizes the coefficients but also tracks various information,
including MSE, optimized coefficients, and the concentrations of different populations over time.
This tracking allows for a comprehensive analysis of the parameter estimation process.


In summary, the code provides a structured and efficient solution for estimating parameters
in a set of differential equations. By encapsulating the functionality within a class and
incorporating features like early stopping and improved parameter initialization, the code is
well-suited for practical parameter estimation tasks.
