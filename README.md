Reproduction of "Growth Factor-Induced MAPK Network Topology" Study
------------------------------------------------

This repository is dedicated to reproducing the work presented
in the article titled "Growth Factor-Induced MAPK Network
Topology Shapes Erk Response Determining PC-12 Cell Fate"
by Silvia D. M. Santos, Peter J. Verveer, and Philippe
I. H. Bastiaens, originally published in 2007. In our 
research endeavor, we aim to replicate the findings 
and methodologies outlined in this influential paper.


Overview
-----------------------------------------------
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive
 collection of files and resources related to our 
efforts in reproducing the study. Our approach 
includes both the original methodology, "Modular
 Response Analysis (MRA)," a sensitivity analysis 
developed by Kholodenko et al., and a novel approach
 leveraging "petab" and "pypesto" tools, implemented in Python.


Folder Structure
------------------------------------------------
• - Additional_resources : Contains files and materials related to
the replication of the original study using the MRA approach.
(some results may not match those of the study due to the use of different statistical methods)



 • petab_&_pypesto : This folder is dedicated to our 
new approach, which utilizes the "petab" and "pypesto"
 tools. We have developed Python code to replicate the
 study's findings using this modern framework.
