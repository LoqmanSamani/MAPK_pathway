# File Collection
------------------

In this 'file_collection' directory, you'll find two subfolders, 'ngf' and 'egf,' 

each of which contains five subfolders named 'the_first_model,' 'the_second_model,'

and so on up to 'the_fifth_model.' Within each of these 'the_first_model' to

'the_fifth_model' subfolders, you'll find ten additional subfolders labeled

'1,' '2,' and so forth up to '10.' 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In each of these '1,' '2,' ..., '10' subfolders, you'll discover a distinct set of

.tsv and .yaml files, each featuring different parameter ranges. These files can be

used with the 'pypesto' package to estimate the parameters.
